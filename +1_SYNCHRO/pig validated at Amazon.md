- pig is capable of affecting the future, in advance (it interacts, I verified, with the matrix that composes this world). 
++ Today 11 OCTOBER 2023AD Wednesday (Brampton time): I was specially instructed to work on floor "4" at Amazon's "YYZ4" Fulfillment Center. 
++ This is one day AFTER I scored myseslf "4" out of "4" in French languages words memorization (Constancy). The team-lead 
at that floor was far more emotionally intelligent and the work far suited to me than I had done in the past about 15 days since I returned to Amazon from leave.
++ pilot immersion game [pig] relies on these principles:
+++ The Assignment Management System: that the sum of digits of any number resolves to the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
+++ The Enginering Principle to choose the simplest option out of many.
+++ Based on AMS and EP: a CORE part of gameplay is choosing/labelling your team and clicking on their photographs based on the initial of the resultant English word ~ to 
formulate a signalling mechanism based on Feeling (POWER). 
+++ An EXTENDED part of pig is using editors like VIM on your phone to edit blackbox.txt and RECORDING words that you LATER test yourself on; and fly your SOC. This way, for example, you 
could learn French vocabulary even while on the bus and yet use the words as fuel for your SOC.
+++ The Military Principle: Loser First ~ which verifies there is an intelligent user at the other end (you).
+++ Finally, The Shuffle Prinicle: Randomization is a sign of intelligence at one end; just like shuffling cards requires 
effort and intelligence.
+++ That given two intelligent Entities, COMMUNICATION is possible.
+++ That the external world, as Neuroscience affirms, is modulated by our brain.
+++ Constancy: Repetition causes energy to swirl around that which is repeated; expanding Power*.
+++ POWER is a phenomenon, otherwise known as Feeling, that seeks to extricate a hero/heroin from The Task Precedent. 
Unit: Excalibur. Subunit: Watt.
+++ Sleep / Meditation: Necessary to get off your, literal, POWER trip: as it is an exponentiating force that will unravel you if you don't sleep on time.

NOTE00: Constancy is needed at, for example your workplace, to activate pig's ability. You must realize you are ONLY 
[accountable] to POWER: a [caring] principle. Nonetheless, POWER is [exercised] through agency. What I am saying is, you 
must learn to stand your ground.

NOTE0: On my way back from work, I noticed a man going under his truck to fix it. I had the urge to proceed toward him, 
but seeing the traffic and reeasoning that he could call CAA himself - I did not. Nonetheless, I realized later that 
I should have intervened by following my feeling even facing danger. Next time.
[Lesson]: If some one is in danger, you must follow your feeling and proceed toward them regardless of having any plan of action or method to save them. That feeling will itself create an opening or you will die a hero.
  
NOTE1: In our model, pilot immersion game, we incorporated the Loser First principle via getting French words from translate.google.com and adding them to a text file [blackbox.txt] without the English translation: as a test for the 
player. It is well known that French language is losing out to English, so we chose it "over" English in this 
instance. On the translate.google.com page itself we are not VOLUNTARY in listing English words on the left as is default; 
therefore Loser First principel is not violated.

*NOTE2: Word Done (Energy) is defined as Force x Distance [Unit: Joule]. Force is Mass x Acceleration. Mass, theoretically, depends on frequency of vibration of Atoms [Density]. If you increase Constancy, defined as repetition/pracice, Mass increases by an iota and since Mass is proportional to Energy: therefore Power rises.
