- All teaching platforms, mechanisms and modicums are based on the following principles:
+ The need for teaching arises from the very principice of Sigularity: that to relate with an inifinitizer; 
in order to prioritize due to limited time: if another is able to teach one something useful and the popular person 
ofcourse can already teach the student something useful; that is a student who can exceed the teacher in a subject [remind the teacher of Teacher's prowess lost to speed] and then relent (gift): this is the basis of the need for Teaching. 
+ If we regard note taking as the basis of every activity, whether speaking French or horse riding; then, especially since 
we know that Certification is necessary to ascend per the Law Of Game [Certificate = |E|/'T'+1] - therefore, pig 
has universal utility.
++ For example, if you wanted to learn Coding; pig's Allied line interface [Ali] can be used to TEST whether you 
can TRANSLATE pseudocode in ENGLISH to Python language. You would store the Python code you memorize, e.g. via ChatGPT, 
in our text file [blackbox.txt] and then reverse-engineer the pseudocode.
++ Communication is actually Gamification of a challenge, making it fun and therefore sustainable in terms of achievement. 
++ Challenges that are not gamified, that are based on brute force, include Emergency response/intervention. 
Rapid response. Forwards.
++ Constancy breeds Attention; like the Eagle that NOTICES a discrepancy - swooping in, since it is constantly flying 
over the same territory. Attention is the secret to download any material substance, miracle-working essentially, from 
the POWER supernal. For, if you are not attentive - POWER can trust you with advanced toys. You will end up accidently 
hurting others.
