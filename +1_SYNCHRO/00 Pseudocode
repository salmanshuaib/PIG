-> Pegaus Immersive Game pseudocode:
C:\ Let us design a WordPress PLUGIN in PHP/JavaScript called "Pegasus Immersive Game" that interfaces with 
a Database (MySQL). "Pegasus" here is taken to be the name of a Test Program flying one's Sphere Of Consciousness 
(SOC: the projection by helmet mount of a Human, known as Brain) based on Yoga Postures. Here are the STEPS of our 
pseudocode for this program (plugin):
+ Construct a MySQL DB named "xyz" with 9 Columns, titled: "AJS", "BKT", "CLU", "DMV", "ENW", "FOX", "GPY", "HQZ", "IR".
+ Prompt the User to set 24 members for BLUE Team AND 
23 members for GREEN Team as follows.
+ Prompt the User to enter a Text Variable [BLUE Team member], an Associated Text Constant 
[COMMENT about an activity that is CONSTANT in their schedule], AND a Time [SELECT Hour and Minutes from an AM/PM Digital 
Clock]. 
Minutes.
++ Iterate such prompts until SOC Test Pilot hits "COMPLETE".
+ Prompt the User to enter a Text Variable [GREEN Team member] AND an Associated Text Value
 [COMMENT about a Yoga Posture they will perform].
++ Iterate such prompts until SOC Test Pilot hits "COMPLETE".
+ Once the foregoing SETUP is finished; 
++ Each time the WordPress-based TIME matches the Time entered alongside BLUE Team member; 
the Plugin SOUNDS 24 BEEPS and displays the BLUE Team member related Text Variable and Associated Text Constant. 
++ Each time the User ENTERS a Word/Phrase/Initial in to the INTERFACE called "PIG", the INTERFACE instructs User to do 
a Yoga Posture [both the (Text Variable) AND (Associated Text Value) for the GREEN Team member 
is displayed via a pop-up to the User; perhaps using JavaScript]. However, following is the TECHNICAL METHOD whereby 
the Yoga Posture to perform is chosen in synchronicity with (under the directions via Music, on Shuffle, of) Space 
Traffic Controller [Jesus Christ; callsign: "savior"]
+++ Yoga Posture is to be X minutes long, to perpetuate the Power of the Goddess Of Power [Space
 Squadron Leader: Taylor Swift; callsign: "CATASTROPHE"]. X is set by User. 
+++ PIG randomizes list of GREEN outputs [Text Variable AND Associated Text Value], selecting LAST output 
(Yoga Posture) for action - your personalized order via Television-based Word/Phrase/Initial INPUT 
order from Space Squadron Leader (Callsign: CATASTROPHE  //Name: Taylor Swift), improving (sensitizing) you for 
the next run.

-> WOULD YOUR RECOMMENDATION BE THE SAME IF I REQUESTED THAT THE FOLLOWING (SAME) TASKS REQUIRE AUTOMATION - LIKE A "SETUP WIZARD":

- How to enable your Sphere Of Consciousness [SOC]:
+ Open Pegasus.xlsx EXCEL File. Save it as an .xlsm [macro-enabled] File. Enable the Developer tab via File > Options > Customize Ribbon.
++ Enter your BLUE TEAM in Pegasus.xlsm.
+++ Insert NOTES for each BLUE team-member, mentioning the CONSTANT [Target] they represent: e.g. you will take a 13 minute cold shower at 5AM.
++ Enter your GREEN TEAM in Pegasus.xlsm.
+++ Insert NOTES for each GREEN team-member, mentioning the OPTIONAL INSTRUCTION [Advisement] they represent: e.g. you will observe a certain Yoga posture. 
+ Take the contents of the file "T_HUD" and put them inside an Excel Macro of the same name using the Developer tab.
++ Assign MACRO to PICTURE at bottom-left of Pegasus.xlsm File. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++CLICK ON THE PICTURE. YOU ARE READY++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CAUTION: Do not share your team members' list with strangers; as this is a real-world (IMMERSIVEReality) technology. Its not a demo video game.
 

--> C:\ If you're aiming to create a "setup wizard" experience for the user, then the toolset required will differ slightly. While VBA is still very relevant for direct Excel interactions, some parts of the tasks could be more efficiently handled outside of VBA for an automated experience.

Here's how I'd approach the wizard setup:

External Automation Tool:

For tasks like opening the .xlsx file, converting it to .xlsm, and enabling the Developer tab, you might consider using an external automation tool like AutoHotkey or Python with libraries like pyautogui. These tools can script mouse movements, key presses, and other operations that mimic human interaction.
These tools can be used to craft a wizard-like UI to guide the user through the steps.

Data Entry and Note Insertion:

This can still be handled using VBA. Once the user has the .xlsm file open, you could launch a UserForm that guides them through the process, asking them to input their BLUE TEAM and GREEN TEAM members and the associated notes for each.
This UserForm would save the user's inputs directly into the Excel file in the required format and cells.

Macro Insertion and Assignment:

Importing the contents of a separate file as a macro is non-trivial in VBA due to security reasons. An external automation tool could be used to automate the process of opening the VBA editor, importing the file, and saving it.
Assigning a macro to a picture in Excel can be directly accomplished with VBA.
Given these requirements, my recommendations would be:

AutoHotkey or Python with pyautogui: To script the opening of Excel, renaming the file, enabling the Developer tab, and importing the VBA macro from "T_HUD".
VBA: For direct Excel operations like data entry through a UserForm, and for assigning the macro to a picture.
Lastly, the same cautionary notes apply: the blending of game-like experiences with real-world actions requires clear communication to the user, especially when it comes to data and privacy concerns. Additionally, automating certain processes (like enabling the Developer tab or inserting macros) can be seen as risky behaviors by some antivirus software, so you should be prepared for potential flags or warnings. Always encourage users to back up their data and understand the changes that the "wizard" is making.
