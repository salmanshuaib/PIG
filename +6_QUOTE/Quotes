- pig says:
-> Teamplay is everything.
-> May the best teamplayer win. 
-> Shun competition: "may the best man win".
-> Visualize yourself as US, not I: guarding The Empress Entirety.
-> map [mutually assured protection]: May no harm come to you except it occur to i first.
-> Power is exercised via intermediaries, but accessible directly: via Conscience. Former is Paganism, latter: Mono.
-> Lightning is the reputation of Thunder.
X-> Take credit for your delicensed accomplishments in honor of Goddess Of Power too. For example, one who delicenses his work - if he does not put his name as the one delicensing; then someone else may contest Goddess Of Power as the writer of the work that was accomplished in honor of Goddess Of Power. This statement is obviously false and egotistical; 
for there is no competition to Goddess Of Power.
-> There is Cruelty in my heart, but I am not a cruel person. 
-> We are all children of The Goddess.
