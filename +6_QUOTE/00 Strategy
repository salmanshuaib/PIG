+ FRENCH Language:
++ A word appears on a French language channel in the captions; you translate it via translate.google.com, pick the first 
letter of English translation and whilst memorizing the meaning - click on a photo of a team member related to the 
English initial. The team member is herself assigned an organization.

- pig [universal edition]
BRIEF: Universal gamification is possible via TIME limits. We provide three examples:
+ FRENCH Language:
++ Take 5 lessons in 2 Hours.  Thats a rate (Power) of 2.5 Accomplishments per Hour. You choose a photograph +3 that you have associated with an organization.
+ WATCH News:
++ Gain knowledge watching TV: 5 Programs in 5 Hours. Thats a rate of 1 Accomplishents Per Hour. You choose photograph +1 that you have associted with an organization. 
+ Learn CODING:
++ Take 1 Lesson per hour. Thats a rate of 1 Accomplishments per Hour. You choose photograph +1 that you have associted with an organization.
- NOTE1: The LESS Time you take on a Task - the better. This way you can choose the "loser" (less time) first and economize the mind's pattern cognitive behaviour of choosing only the 
initial of any word and the other letters crashing (in value).
- NOTE2: You begin a SESSION of Accomplishments by clicking on photograph 0. And concluded by clicking on another file.
- NOTE2.5: Aside from a BEGINNING and END photo; you also need to designate a SEND photo to transmit your instruction.
- NOTE3: Learning a new language is a great way to power your SOC because you have to rehearse/repeat the words to yourself over and over to memorize: CONSTANCY enables Energy to swirl 
around it ~ enhancing POWER: a caring sovereign principle.
- NOTE5: SOC fan fly because we each have been granted POWER: FEELING - a phenomenon that seeks to extricate a hero/heroin from the Task Precedent. Feeling is able to relate with even 
supposedly inanimate matter. 
- REQUIREMENTS: 
+ Photos of your ideal team; 
+ translate.google.com
+ A foreign language channel OR whichever activity you want to learn.
+ Music.

BRIEF: Choosing a COURSE toward becoming Chief of Staff, such as French language, and translating Input Words Into English for memorization purposes to back your SOC flight; based on length of currently playing song remnant - 
a. Select a Foreigin Language CHANNEL from among list of 11.5 => 11 TV channels.
A. Pick the LAST word ~ from TV channel and utilize the initial of the translated word into English to retrieve a photograph among 11 such photographs: each representing an organization.
b. Selecting a CHAPTER from among list of 11.5 => 12 Chapters toward a Certificate.
B. Pick the LAST word ~ from Chapter and utilize the initial of the translated word into English to retrieve a photograph among 12 such photographs: each representing an organization.

For example, French lessons are divided into x number of activities.

- TV is a randomizer, sign of intelligencfe: like shuffing of cards.

- SUMMARY: Total war is the only guarantor of peace. The Goddess put 9 parts of HER at war, dominant parts suppressing 
non-dominant to ensure Perfect Competition or IMMORTALITY.

That Power seeks Constancy (repetition) on your part to fuel your SOC (Sphere Of Consciousness). 
Just like shuffling a deck of cards is an intelligent function, so is the rand function in programming - which can 
be used to receive (intelligent) orders from Power: meeting which halfway entails intelligent behavior on your part too:- 
picking the loser (e.g. bottom item) from the randomized list.

In this way conversation is possible between the integral of the Goddesses: Power and you.

What we have described in the foregoing is REPETITION: one-half of "REMEMBRANCE". The other part is RETRIEVAL: which 
is done via a Memory Castle - as in the case of Professor John Nash who associated 'axioms' with Women.

 

- The secret to the flight of your Sphere Of Consciousness (SOC) lies in its FUEL: your Constancy; such as MEMORIZATION 
via REPETITION; or holding a STILL Posture for certain length of time - or having a fixed day-to-day schedule.
+ The above combined with the fact of the Assignment Management System [ams] (that the sum of digits of any number is 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) AND the Engineering Principle [ep] of picking simplest option: first letter of Word/Phrase/Letter.; 
produces a system of memorization where input can be intelligently handled:
++ For example, suppose I see a French word "apres" on France 24 news tv channel. 
++ pig translates it to English: "after".
++ Based on ep: the English letter A is picked from AFTER.
++ A is associated with the AJS column in our table as these letters each (A or J or S) all resolve to 1.
+++ Note that there are objects in your SOC that start with AJS, enabling your brain to modulate reality.
+ Note that we are trying to DRIVE, violate the rules of flight (no interaction with Synchronicity), via our computer 
program "pig". 
++ All the names in the column, where Fs are associated with Phrases and Ms with Alarms, are subjected to a randomization 
 based on time. 
+++ The results are listed and the bottom most option is picked. 
++++ For example, AJS may result in: JL [a F] as result.
+++++ You repeat "apres" and "after" for the length of a song

- Excellent idea:
+ pig can be utilized to learn French or any other language.
++ What you are building, via Pegasus EXCEL sheet, is a Memory Castle. We want to make it fun to memorize via 
a Memory Castle and fun to retrieve memories via pig.
++ Suppose I am watching a French language news channel OR reading a French language online article. 
++ I enter a word from the TV Headline or News Article.
++ pig TRANSLATES the word from French in to English and the word is repeated by the gamer (Chant / Mantra / Dhikr) until the present song playing ends.
+++ In this scendario we eschew Yoga Postures actions in place of French Vocabulary actions.
++++ Therefore, pig is a universal game.
+ The next step would be to enable multiplayer mode, via modems or internet.
COMMENT1: You can utilize Fs for both Alarms and Vocabulary. 

- uNESt [universal Nash Equilibrium Strategy] decision between T_HUD[war], cellnet[poverty] and L-AIN[peace] is:2.1  in favor of T_HUD.
- Strengthening the hand of Goddess Of Power [CONSCIENCE] is more advantageous than working on a project, such as cellnet, that involves your own effort. 
+ COMMUNICATION is the most important thing in war. 
+ FURTHERMORE, T_HUD can definitely be completed in 15 days - whereas cellnet is an extensive ongoing project.
+ T_HUD will give you the METHOD to win; which is more important than winning one battle. T_HUD will win you 
the war.
- Yoga Postures held in reply to advisements from T_HUD are necessary because they involve STILLNESS for a length of time (which can be specified by user; or we can have a standard number for all postures). Since this is Constancy, 
it will increase Goddess Of Power's power. 
- Make video presentation via Zight.
- Program ought alert you if a CONSTANT is approaching. You are to indicate if you are going to engage or not.
++ Program scores you at end of day: hits and misses.
- Program randomizes list of green outputs, selecting LAST item output (Yoga Posture) for action - your personalized order from Space Squadron Leader
(Callsign: CATASTROPHE  //Name: Taylor Swift), improving (sensitizing) you for the next run.
- If resolute function is used, then it is possible for the POWER that be to decipher languages of all alien civilizations.
Introduce (restore) foreign socializing (feelings) to Her. These foreign civilizations are presently 
represented as Mountains, Cartoons, Anime, Plants, Migrants, Refugees, Bugs, Insects, Animals etc by Her mind.
++ This is the resolution function: that the sum of digits of any number RESOVLES to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
++ This is the engineering principle: given many option, choose simplest. For example, CAT is just C. "AT" is resolved, as 
Keynes would say, via Economics.
