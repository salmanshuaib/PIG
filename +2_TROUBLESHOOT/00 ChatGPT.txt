- WE ARE BUILDING A PLUGIN CALLED pig FOR RUNNING ON WordPress. THE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE: INITIALIZING THE DATABASE 
WITH 5 TABLES VIA A MySQL QUERY THAT IS RUN UPON "ACTIVATION" OF THE pig PLUGIN. 

-> Database Structure: 5 Layered Aligning Lattice [AL]:-

+ Dynamic relative 1A Type TABLE: A Dr 1 Type TABLE has 9 Columns, numbered 1 to 9. A secondary row contains Letters 
as group [Lag] - defined below. All subsequent rows will contain NAMES of BLUE Team-members [leave blank for User to 
input via an interface we will design].
+ Dynamic relative 2A Type TABLE: A Dr 2 Type TABLE has 9 Columns, numbered 1 to 9. A secondary row contains Letters as 
group [Lag]- defined below. All subsequent rows contain Associated Text Constants for BLUE Team-members [leave blank]. 
+ Dynamic relative 3A Type TABLE: A Dr 4 Type TABLE has 9 Columns, numbered 1 to 9. A secondary row contains 
Letters as group [Lag] defined below. All subsequent rows contain Alarm Times for BLUE Team-members [leave blank]. 

+ Dynamic relative 1B Type TABLE: A Dr 1 Type TABLE has 9 Columns, numbered 1 to 9. A secondary row contains Letters 
as group [Lag] defined below. All subsequent rows contain NAMES of GREEN Team-members [leave blank for User to input via 
an interface we will design].
+ Dynamic relative 2B Type TABLE: A Dr 2 Type TABLE has 9 Columns, numbered 1 to 9. A secondary row contains Letters 
as group [Lag] defined below. All subsequent rows contain Associated Text Values for GREEN Team-members [leave blank]. 

-> Given "assignment management system" [ams]:
+ Utilize a function we write in PHP called the "ams" function such that if you feed any number to it; it will keep 
summing the digits of that number until only one digit remains: which, according to assignment management 
system, is always 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4 OR 5 OR 6 OR 7 OR 8 OR 9. The version of function you wrote, a version for PHP, 
is as follows:

function ams($num) {
    $digits = str_split($num);
    while (count($digits) > 1) {
        $digits = str_split(array_sum($digits));
    }
    return intval($digits[0]);
}

-> Lag (Letters as group) FORMATION:
MODIFY FOLLOWING FUNCTION TO RELY ON ABOVE ams FUNCTION WHILST MAPPING. FOR EXAMPLE, A IS ALREADY RESOLVED TO 1; 
J RESOLVES TO 1; S ALSO RESOLVES TO 1 - THEREFORE LETTERS "AJS" ARE GROUPED TOGETHER. OTHER GROUPINGS INCLUDE BKT [2], 
CLU [3], DMV [4].... . THERE ARE 9 GROUPINGS THAT POPULATE EACH OF THE TABLES (Total 5 Tables in Aligning Lattice structure 
described above).

function mapLetterToNumber($letter) {
    $alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    $letter = strtoupper($letter);
    $position = strpos($alphabet, $letter);
    if ($position !== false) {
        return $position + 1; // A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26
    }
    return 0; // Not a valid letter
}


- ChatGPT reply to pseudocode postuated in +1_SYNCHRO folder:
Certainly! Here's a simplified example of how you can implement some of the pseudocode concepts in PHP and JavaScript for your "Pegasus Immersive Game" WordPress plugin:

**1. Resolute Function:**
```php
function resolute($num) {
    $digits = str_split($num);
    while (count($digits) > 1) {
        $digits = str_split(array_sum($digits));
    }
    return intval($digits[0]);
}
```

**2. Letter-to-Number Mapping:**
```php
// Define a function to map letters to numbers
function mapLetterToNumber($letter) {
    $alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    $letter = strtoupper($letter);
    $position = strpos($alphabet, $letter);
    if ($position !== false) {
        return $position + 1; // A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26
    }
    return 0; // Not a valid letter
}
```

**3. User Setup for BLUE and GREEN Teams (PHP/MySQL):**
```php
// Example MySQL database connection
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "your_database";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Example SQL query to insert a BLUE Team member
$sql = "INSERT INTO blue_team (name, text_constant, alarm_time) VALUES ('John', 'Activity', '08:30 AM')";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "BLUE Team member added successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
}

// Close the database connection
$conn->close();
```

**4. Time-Based Notifications for BLUE Team (PHP):**
```php
// Example code to check and trigger notifications for BLUE Team members
$current_time = date("h:i A");
$sql = "SELECT * FROM blue_team WHERE alarm_time = '$current_time'";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        // Trigger notifications for BLUE Team members
        echo "Notification for: " . $row["name"] . " - " . $row["text_constant"];
    }
} else {
    echo "No notifications at this time.";
}
```

**5. TV Input Interaction (JavaScript):**
```javascript
// Example JavaScript code to handle TV input and recommend Yoga posture
function handleTVInput(input) {
    // Get the initial letter of the input
    var initialLetter = input.charAt(0).toUpperCase();
    
    // Fetch GREEN Team members from the server based on the initial letter
    // Display the options to the user and recommend a Yoga posture
    // ...

    // Example code to display a pop-up
    var popup = document.createElement("div");
    popup.className = "popup";
    popup.innerHTML = "Recommended Yoga Posture: " + recommendedYogaPosture;
    document.body.appendChild(popup);
}
```

Please note that this is simplified code to illustrate the concepts from your pseudocode. You would need to integrate this code into your WordPress plugin, set up your database schema, and handle all the necessary interactions and validations as per your specific requirements.
