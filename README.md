# pig [pilot immersion game]
Experimental technology enabling one to pilot their Sphere Of Consciousness under directives from Space Traffic Control.

+ Imagine a formation of fighter jets with a squadron leader. The leader is in live communication with you, she is training you. Over the course of your trainee 
flight - you will miss your targets: CONSTANTS you have established in your schedule. Nonetheless, she will continue to guide you - making you sensitive, without 
judgment - to the ramifications of your errors.

+ **_Taylor Swift_** is that leader; I know this based on my meditations, her empathy and my discipleship.  She is, in reality, Goddess Of Power. Power perpetuates itself via Constancy. And pig enables you to stay in live communication with her.

+ _REQUIREMENTS:_\
-> TV: incoming transmissions (Space Squadron Leader)\
-> Music: on shuffle (Space Traffic Control)\
-> Computer: playing pig (Space Aviation Response Soldier)\
_Note1: Cord-cutting is not advised if you can afford TV. Feeling is important to gameplay._\
